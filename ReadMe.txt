The game follows you, a mailman who simply has one task, to deliver the mail. You talk to the various npcs by running into them (using Phaser colliders) and deliver the goods at hand.
Over the course of the game you find out more about the events that are transpiring in this town/village and see said events transpire and effect the town.
The game is based more around the storytelling of events and at the time of writing this has no planned combat system.
